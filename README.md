This repository contains some of my personal studies while developing and studying openGL applications and related APIs.

Everything was developed in MacOS, using VSCode. Some libraries were installed using Brew e others with VCPKG.

In order to run the projects, you must configure the .vscode files (c_cpp_properties.json and tasks.json) to replace the current libraries/includes path with your own.

OpenGL Studies

This repository contains some of my personal studies while developing and studying openGL applications and related APIs.

Everything was developed in MacOS, using VSCode. Some libraries were installed using Brew e others with VCPKG.

In order to run the projects, you must configure the .vscode files (c_cpp_properties.json and tasks.json) to replace the current libraries/includes path with your own.
